# Networks

### This folder contains all various networks we used

All contents of the `tflite` folder were downloaded from [Tensorflow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub)

- Note that to get access to lraspp_mobilenet_v3_small and to train it, we edited the `torchvision/models/segmentation/lraspp.py` file in torchvision's source code, and it's located in the `pytorch` folder. In the future, we might contribute it to PyTorch's source code along with our trained weights.
