# DeepLearningOnDevice

Running Semantic Segmentation Neural Networks on a Raspberry Pi Zero V2

## Project Structure:

- `nets/` - all neural networks that we used in this project, along with their sources and scripts we used to measure their accuracy etc.
- `on_rpi/` - scripts that run on the Raspberry Pi itself
