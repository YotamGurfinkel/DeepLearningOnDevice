# DeepLearning-ondevice

Running a trained Neural Network on a Raspberry Pi Zero

Steps to make it happen:

1. Got pytorch and pytorch-vision wheels from this git repo: https://github.com/isakbosman/pytorch_arm_builds
2. Compiled python3.7 for Raspberry Pi, required to install wheels compiled for this version
